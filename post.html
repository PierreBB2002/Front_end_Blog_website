                <h3>1. The best areas to stay at in Mexico City</h3>
                <p>If you want a place near the city center, I suggest to you this area to stay in.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>This neighborhood is near the park, Reforma Avenue, which is home to several well-known monuments, and the historic center is only a short drive away. There are a lot of eateries and coffee shops in this particular region.
                    Given that it is a business district, it is undoubtedly extremely safe. </p>
                <h3>2. Must Visit Sites in Mexico City</h3>
                <p>The central square, Zócalo, also called Plaza de la Constitución, is the primary location you must see in Mexico City's historic district.
                    At 57,600 square meters, it is among the biggest public squares in the world.
                    When I arrived, I was very astounded by the square's size and the might of the enormous Mexican flag. </p>
                <p>The Zócalo has hosted numerous significant occasions during its lengthy history.
                    Other noteworthy locations, such as the National Palace and the Metropolitan Cathedral, can be found on various sides of the square.
                    I strongly advise paying a brief visit to the City government building across from the cathedral, which houses a small but quite fascinating museum detailing important events in Mexico City.
                    There is no charge to enter this museum. </p>
